# To-Do-List-App-con-Mejora-de-IA
Test
Part 1 – To-Do List App (Foundation)
Build a simple to-do list app with the following requirements:
Framework: Next.js


Database: Supabase (data must persist — no local storage)


Hosting: Vercel


AI Assistant: Use Cursor (preferred) or Lovable/Bolt


Core Features:
Add a task


Edit a task


Mark a task complete


Data persists after refresh


Store in Supabase (basic user identifier like name/email is fine)



Part 2 – Chatbot Enhancement
Extend your app with a chatbot interface:
Integrate with N8N (mandatory)


Chatbot connects with Supabase (directly or via your own API — API gets bonus points)


When a task is added, call an AI to enhance the title (e.g., make it clearer, break it into steps, or enrich it with relevant info).


Bonus Points:
Add WhatsApp integration (Evolution API or similar).


Use a filter so only messages with #to-do list trigger the bot.



Deliverables
When finished, please submit:
N8N Access (so we can view your workflow)


Deployed Webapp URL


GitHub Repo URL (public)


Loom Video (5-10 minutes max) explaining your solution and key decisions
